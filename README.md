## Exa Search Optimizations (Updated 2025-01-05)

The search functionality has been significantly enhanced to provide better quality results:

### Enhanced Search Method
- **Uses `searchAndContents()`** instead of basic search for richer metadata
- **Text snippets** (1000 characters) for better context
- **Highlights** show relevant content sections  
- **Summaries** provide quick article overviews

### Query Preprocessing
- **Automatic optimization** removes unnecessary words and adds context
- **News context** automatically added for better article discovery
- **Minimum length** ensures semantic search effectiveness
- Example: "AI" becomes "latest news about AI news articles analysis"

### Quality Scoring & Filtering
Each result gets scored (0-1) based on:
- **Content richness** (title quality, summary length, highlights)
- **Publication recency** (recent articles get boost)
- **Domain reputation** (trusted news sources prioritized)
- **Spam detection** (low-quality domains filtered out)

Results below 0.3 quality score are filtered out automatically.

### Advanced Parameters
The search API supports additional parameters:
```javascript
{
  "query": "search term",
  "numResults": 25,
  "includeDomains": ["reuters.com", "nytimes.com"],  // Optional
  "excludeDomains": ["spam.com"],                    // Optional  
  "searchType": "auto"                              // auto/neural/keyword
}
```

### Trusted Domain Boosting
Results from reputable sources get quality score increases:
- Reuters, AP, BBC, CNN, New York Times, Washington Post, Wall Street Journal

These optimizations provide search result quality comparable to the Exa MCP while maintaining cost efficiency.

## Performance & Error Handling

### Smart Caching
- **Global shared cache**: All users benefit from cached content across sessions
- **Content hash validation**: Only refetches when content actually changes, not just on time expiry
- **Domain-aware TTL**: News sites (2h), financial sites (1h), social media (30m), blogs (12h)
- **LRU memory management**: Automatic eviction of least-used entries when cache reaches 2500 URLs (~125MB)
- **Intelligent cleanup**: Removes expired entries every 30 minutes to maintain performance
- **High capacity**: Supports analysis of up to 2000 URLs without cache pressure

### Graceful Error Handling
- **Bot Detection**: Handles sites that block automated access (e.g., Yahoo Finance) with user-friendly messages
- **Network Issues**: Graceful handling of timeouts and connection problems
- **Content Extraction**: Clear messaging when pages lack extractable content
- **Visual Error States**: Color-coded error types with helpful explanations
- **Smart Report Updates**: Only regenerates reports when removing successful analyses, not error results
- **Reset Functionality**: Complete analysis reset with confirmation dialog for starting fresh

### Site Compatibility
- **Anti-bot evasion**: Modern browser headers and user agents
- **Retry logic**: Exponential backoff for transient failures
- **Multiple redirects**: Handles complex redirect chains
- **Content parsing**: Semantic HTML parsing for better text extraction
- **Site-specific extractors**: Specialized handling for major automotive and financial sites
- **Published date extraction**: Comprehensive date parsing from multiple sources (JSON-LD, meta tags, HTML elements)

### Enhanced User Experience
- **Instant Button Feedback**: All buttons provide immediate tactile feedback with click animations and scale effects
- **Immediate Processing State**: Search and analysis buttons instantly show processing state to prevent double-clicks
- **Comprehensive Copy Functions**: Copy overall reports, individual reports, or bulk individual reports with enhanced headers
- **Statistical Headers**: Individual report copies include summary statistics (URL counts, sentiment distribution, average confidence, top themes)
- **URL Processing Stats**: Reports display detailed breakdowns of successful vs failed URL processing
- **Visual State Management**: Clear loading states, progress indicators, and error classifications

## Known Limitations

Some websites actively block automated access:
- **Financial sites** (Yahoo Finance, Bloomberg) use sophisticated bot detection
- **Social media** platforms restrict scraping
- **Subscription sites** may require authentication

For these sites, the app will show clear error messages rather than failing silently.
